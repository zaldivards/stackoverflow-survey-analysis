# Project Motivation
This analysis was intended to analyze the relation between the respondents' education and their parents' and how this impacts on their salaries. Also, to find some of the factors that impact the peoples' job satisfaction.

# Project files

**stackoverflow.ipynb** is the only file in this project.

# Results

- I found that the higher the education level of the respondents’ parents, the higher the average salary is for the respondents.

- In some cases the overpayment impacts(possitively) the job satisfaction of the people. Nevertheless, extra factors such as the work environment and the functions of the people in their companies can cause satisfaction to decay.

- People who are employed but actively looking for a job have low job satisfaction. Also, I found that the reason for this may be that they are underpaid in some way.
